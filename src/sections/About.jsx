                I am a Web Developer with two years of experience specializing
                in React, building modern and responsive web applications. I
                focus on clean UI implementation, reusable components, and
                scalable frontend architecture. I work confidently with
                JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and have experience integrating APIs
                and managing application state. I also have working knowledge of
                SQL and MySQL, enabling effective collaboration across the
                development lifecycle. I am a Computer Science graduate with a
                strong foundation in problem-solving and software development
                best practices.
